    "Welcome to the first notebook in series of tutorials covering deep learning research of lung cancer using RadIO. Here you will learn about (1) general approach of RadIO when working with dataset of scans and (2) perform basic preprocessing operations (load of data into memory and resize of scans). As you will see in a minute, the (1) will save you the trouble of looping through the dataset that cannot fit into memory. In turn, learning (2) will give you a good idea of how one can build complex preprocessing pipelines using RadIO.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will work with [LUNA16 competition dataset](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/), consisting of 888 cancer-annotated examples of scans of Computational Tomography (CT-scans). Annotations is simply a csv-table that contains location and diameter of cancerous nodules. In order to follow the tutorial, we advice you to download at least part of this dataset on [this link](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/download/) (you will need a registration).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can download a small set of scans along with cancer-annotations [here](some-dropbox-link). The archive takes no more than 500 MB and is just enough to get started with RadIO."
