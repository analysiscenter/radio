Welcome to RadIO's documentation!
=================================

**RadIO** is a framework for data science research of computed tomography (CT) imaging.

Main features:

- Asynchronously load **DICOM** and **MetaImage** (mhd/raw) files
- Dump files to `blosc <http://blosc.org/>`_ to compress datasets and thus accelerate loading
- Transform and augment CT-scans in parallel for faster preprocessing
- Create concise chainable workflows with ``actions`` or use tailored :doc:`pipelines <intro/pipelines>` for preprocessing or model training
- Train with ease a zoo of state-of-the-art neural networks for classification or semantic segmentation
- Sample crops of any size from CT-scans for comprehensive training
- Customize :ref:`distribution of crop locations <sample_crops_from_scan>` for improved training
- Predict :meth:`on the whole scan <.CTImagesMaskedBatch.predict_on_scan>`.


`The documentation <#contents>`_ contains a comprehensive review of RadIO's capabilities. While `tutorials <https://github.com/analysiscenter/radio/tree/master/tutorials>`_ provide ready-to-use code blocks and a practical demonstration of the most important RadIO features.


Tutorials
---------

There are four tutorials available:

* In the `first <https://github.com/analysiscenter/radio/tree/master/tutorials/RadIO.I.ipynb>`_ one you can learn how to set up a dataset of CT-scans and define a basic preprocessing workflow.
* The `second tutorial <https://github.com/analysiscenter/radio/tree/master/tutorials/RadIO.II.ipynb>`_ contains in-depth discussion of preprocessing and augmentation actions.
* The `third tutorial <https://github.com/analysiscenter/radio/tree/master/tutorials/RadIO.III.ipynb>`_ explains how to generate batches to train a neural network.
* The `fourth tutorial <https://github.com/analysiscenter/radio/tree/master/tutorials/RadIO.IV.ipynb>`_ will help you configure and train a neural network to detect cancer.

Preprocess scans with chained actions
-------------------------------------

Preprocessing module contains a set of :doc:`actions <intro/preprocessing>`
to efficiently prepare a dataset of CT-scans for neural networks training.

Say, you have a bunch of **DICOM** scans with varying shapes.
First, you create an index and define a dataset::

    from radio import CTImagesBatch
    from dataset import FilesIndex, Dataset

    dicom_ix = FilesIndex(path='path/to/dicom/*', no_ext=True)         # set up the index
    dicom_dataset = Dataset(index=dicom_ix, batch_class=CTImagesBatch) # init the dataset of dicom files

You may want to resize the scans to equal shape **[128, 256, 256]**,
normalize voxel densities to range **[0, 255]** and dump transformed
scans. This preprocessing can be easily performed with the following
:class:`pipeline <dataset.Pipeline>`::

    pipeline = (
        dicom_dataset.p
        .load(fmt='dicom')
        .resize(shape=(128, 256, 256))
        .normalize_hu()
        .dump('/path/to/preprocessed/scans/')
    )
    pipeline.run(batch_size=20)

See the :doc:`documentation <intro/preprocessing>` for the description of
preprocessing actions implemented in the module.


Preprocess scans using a pre-defined workflow
---------------------------------------------

Pipelines module contains ready-to-use workflows for most frequent tasks.
For instance, if you want to preprocess a dataset of scans named ``dicom_dataset`` and
prepare data for training a neural network, you can simply execute the following
pipeline creator (without spending much time on thinking what actions to choose for
a workflow)::

    from radio.pipelines import get_crops

    nodata_pipeline = get_crops(fmt='raw', shape=(128, 256, 256),
                                nodules=nodules, batch_size=20,
                                share=0.6, nodule_shape=(32, 64, 64))

    dicom_pipeline = dicom_dataset >> nodata_pipeline

    for batch in dicom_pipeline.gen_batch(batch_size=12, shuffle=True):
        # ...
        # train a model here

See the :doc:`documentation <intro/pipelines>` for more information about
ready-made workflows.


Adding a neural network to a workflow
-------------------------------------

``RadIO`` contains proven architectures for classification, segmentation and detection, including neural networks designed specifically
for cancer detection (e.g. ``DenseNoduleNet`` inspired by the state-of-the-art DenseNet, but well suited for 3D CT scans)::

    from radio.preprocessing import CTImagesMaskedBatch as CTIMB
    from radio.models import DenseNoduleNet
    from radio.dataset import F

    training_pipeline = (
        dicom_dataset.p
          .load(fmt='raw')
          .fetch_nodules_info(nodules_df)
          .create_mask()
          .sample_nodules(nodule_size=(32, 64, 64), batch_size=20)
          .init_model('static', DenseNoduleNet, 'net')
          .train_model('net', feed_dict={
              'images': F(CTIMB.unpack, component='images'),
              'labels': F(CTIMB.unpack, component='classification_targets')
          })
    )

    training_pipeline.run(batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

The :doc:`models documentation <intro/models>` contains more information about implemented
architectures and their application to cancer detection.
